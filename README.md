### Overview 
An e-commerce company wants to increase completed purchases by understanding: 
- Why customers abandon carts 
- How personalization affects buying behaviour 
- Which purchase categories drive engagement
This case study focuses on understanding customer behaviour in an e-commerce 
platform, to reduce cart abandonment and improve conversion 
rates.

### Data Source
The primary source of the dataset used for this analysis is the "Sales_Dataset.xlsx" file, which contains detailed information about sales made and customer behaviour.

The dataset contains a total of 602 customer responses covering demographics, 
browsing habits, personalization, and cart behaviour. It is noteworthy that more than 
58% of the customers are females, and out of the total customers, 275 are Gen Z. 
These figures will skew the analysis to show a high presence of females and Gen Z in 
most of the insights.

### Tool(s)
- Microsoft Excel

### Problem Statement 
High cart abandonment is limiting revenue growth. The business needs to identify 
the primary drivers of cart abandonment and also determine other factors that 
influence purchasing behaviour, so it can take targeted action. 

### Key Insights from the Data 
#### Cart Abandonment Is Price-Driven 
The dashboard shows that the most common reason for cart abandonment is finding 
a better price elsewhere, high shipping costs are the third on this list, which indicates 
strong price sensitivity among customers, even interested buyers abandon carts 
when they perceive lower prices elsewhere. 
#### Personalization Encourages Purchasing 
Customers who often receive personalized recommendations tend to purchase more 
frequently, add items to cart more often, and engage more with the platform. This 
shows that personalization is a key growth lever. 
#### Shopping Behaviour Varies by Demographics 
Different age categories show different abandonment patterns. Cart abandonment is 
mostly done by Gen Z. This behaviour is closely followed by Millennials, on the 
contrary, these two age categories also have the highest add to cart browsing. 
The Female customers topped the purchase category, cart completion, and the 
beauty and personal care purchase category enjoyed the highest patronage. 
### Recommendations 
Based on the insights, I recommend price-match incentives, optimized shipping 
strategies, and expanding personalized recommendation systems. 
### Business Impact 
These actions can reduce cart abandonment, improve customer experience, and 
increase overall conversion rates.
